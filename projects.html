<h1>Past projects</h1>

<h2>The Electionary</h2>

<p>I analysed the use of language in American presidential election campaigns from 1960 to the present day, with a group of other students on my Quantitative Methods course at UCL.  I used Python and scrapy to collect and process the data from transcripts of presidential election debates, as well as using the Twitter API to collect data from the 2016 candidates' Twitter activity. We then analysed this data using sentiment analysis techniques. Finally, we produced visualisations (mainly using matplotlib), including a visualisation of geospatial data, and produced a <a href="https://theelectionary.wordpress.com">website</a>. The code used for the project is available <a href="https://github.com/keelanfh/electionary">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Walking to university</h2>

<p>I examined my behaviour walking to and from UCL to see which parts of my journey were faster and slower. I collected location and time data from my phone using <a href="https://moves-app.com/">Moves</a>. I analysed this using Python, and visualised the results using Mapbox. Here's the <a href="walking-to-ucl.pdf">report</a> I produced for this project. I plan to upload the code to GitHub soon, but I haven't got round to it yet.</p>

<h1>Current projects</h1>

<p>I'm currently working on kgraph, a simple interface for matplotlib which will help me when I want to quickly plot reasonable-looking line graphs.</p>
