## About Me

I am a university student who enjoys applying mathematical and computational tools to real-world social challenges. I am particularly interested in the movement of people in cities, and I find using data to improve public transport exciting. I have experience programming in Python and Java, and I am very numerate, but I also know the vital role that communication plays in effecting change.

## Education

I'm a second year undergraduate student of [Arts and Sciences](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/basc), a Liberal Arts programme at [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk). My studies so far have included Quantum Physics, Philosophy and Mathematics.

One of the most enjoyable pieces of work that I've completed was a project where I analysed information about my walking journey to and from UCL to see how I could optimise it. This involved making requests to [an API](https://dev.moves-app.com/) and teaching myself the necessary Python to process JSON data, clean and work with geospatial data, analyse it, and produce visualisations using matplotlib and [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/). I hope to upload the code for this project onto GitHub when I get round to it.
