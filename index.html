<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I am a university student who enjoys applying mathematical and computational tools to real-world social challenges. I am particularly interested in the movement of people in cities, and I also have an interest in data science. I have experience programming in Python and Java, and I am very numerate, but I also know the vital role that communication plays in effecting change.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>I'm a second year undergraduate student of <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/basc">Arts and Sciences</a>, a Liberal Arts programme at <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk">University College London</a>. My studies so far have included Quantum Physics, Programming, Philosophy and Mathematics.</p>
<p>One of the most enjoyable pieces of work that I've completed was a project where I analysed information about my walking journey to and from UCL to see how I could optimise it. This involved making requests to <a href="https://dev.moves-app.com/">an API</a> and teaching myself the necessary Python to process JSON data, clean and work with geospatial data, analyse it, and produce visualisations using matplotlib and <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/">Mapbox Studio</a>. I hope to upload the code for this project onto GitHub when I get round to it.</p>
