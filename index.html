<p>I'm an enthusiastic soon-to-be university graduate of <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/basc">Arts and Sciences</a> broad-based liberal arts degree at <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk">University College London</a>. The modules I've taken include Quantum Physics, Programming, Philosophy, Social Theory and Mathematics.</p>

<p>As part of my degree, I've completed a group project, <a href="https://theelectionary.wordpress.com/">The Electionary</a>, analysing the use of language in American Presidential Election campaigns from 1960 up to the present day. I've analysed my walking behaviour to and from UCL to see which parts of my journey are faster and slower. I've written a quiz application for Android.</p>

<p>I'm also part of the <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/schools-and-young-people/youth-involvement#on-this-page-0">Transport for London Youth Panel</a>, an advisory group which discusses transport issues which affect young people. I'm also part of a similar group which works with Transport for West Midlands. I recently took part in a research project investigating students' experiences of the Bloomsbury campus to inform the plans for development at UCL East.</p>

<p>I relax by singing, and have sung with UCL Symphony Chorus.</p>

<p>Geographically, I'm in the UK, between London and Birmingham. </p>
